This is a project that shows you how to use a Raspberry Pi to control a little screen made up of lights. This screen, called an 8Ã—8 LED matrix, has 64 tiny lights in a grid. We use a special chip called the MAX7219 to make it easy to control what these lights do, so you can show things like scrolling words.
